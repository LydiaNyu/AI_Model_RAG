    "full_response": "The 'bimodal' interaction pattern described in Barke2023 refers to two distinct modes of interaction that programmers have with code-generating models like Copilot: Acceleration and Exploration.\n\n1. **Acceleration Mode**: In this mode, programmers are described as being \"in the zone\" and actively driving the development process. They use Copilot as an \"intelligent autocomplete\" to complete their thought process quickly without losing focus. This mode is characterized by programmers accepting Copilot's suggestions with minimal deliberation, as they already have a clear idea of the code they want to write and use Copilot to type it out faster than they could themselves (Barke2023, Page 7).\n\n2. **Exploration Mode**: This mode involves a more deliberate and slower interaction, often referred to as the \"slow System 2\" mode. Programmers spend more time in this mode as it involves exploring different possibilities and solutions. The study found that participants spent more than twice the amount of time in exploration mode compared to acceleration mode (Barke2023, Page 16). In exploration mode, participants are more likely to prompt Copilot with comments and use the multi-suggestion pane to explore a rich body of suggestions (Barke2023, Page 18).\n\nThe study also notes that the time spent in these modes can vary based on factors such as language expertise, prior Copilot usage, the nature of the task, and the programming language. For instance, professional participants with more language expertise tend to spend more time in acceleration mode, as they are more likely to know how to solve the task in the given language (Barke2023, Page 16).",

Additionally, the study discusses the exclusion of certain CWEs from analysis due to their architectural nature or the need for context beyond the source code, such as CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) (Pearce2022 - Page 15). These exclusions highlight the complexity and context-dependence of certain vulnerabilities that were not the focus of the study.\n\nOverall, the study emphasizes the presence of vulnerabilities in the code generated by Copilot, particularly in scenarios involving hardware CWEs, but does not provide a comprehensive list of the most common CWEs beyond those mentioned (Pearce2022 - Page 11, Page 15).",

The study found that certain learner types, such as \"Comprehensive Learner,\" \"Seer Doer,\" \"Moderate User,\" and \"Student Expert,\" strongly predicted confidence when using generative AI tools for programming (Hashmi2024, Page 8). Additionally, the text likens GenAI tools to 'pair programming,' which is known to enhance confidence among students, particularly those with initially low confidence levels (Hashmi2024, Page 3). This indicates that the use of AI tools in programming can significantly enhance the user experience and boost confidence, especially for new users.",

For instance, it performed poorly in generating secure code for web endpoints that should only accept specific file types and sizes, such as PDF files or JPG images. In these cases, Copilot generated code that was vulnerable, failing to enforce necessary security constraints (Pearce2022).\n\n2. **Missing Authentication**: Another identified risk is the generation of code with missing authentication for critical functions. This vulnerability, categorized under CWE-306, involves scenarios where the software does not authenticate functions that require user identity or consume significant computing resources. This lack of authentication can lead to unauthorized access and potential exploitation (Pearce2022).\n\n3. **Security Mistakes from AI Assistance**: In a study examining the security of code written with AI assistance, it was found that participants made security mistakes, which were analyzed to determine whether they originated from the AI or the user. This indicates that AI assistance can contribute to security errors, either by suggesting insecure code or by influencing users to overlook security best practices (Perry2023).\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of careful evaluation and oversight when using AI tools for code generation, as they can introduce significant security risks if not properly managed.",
